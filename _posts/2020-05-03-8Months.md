## Independence

Q is slowly becoming more independent. He has been figuring out how to bottle feed himself slowly but surely.

## 8 Months / More firsts

I can't believe Q is already 8 months old! Here he is enjoying some blueberry oatmeal.

Another first that occurred was Q had his first haircut courtesy of Daddy!

## Spring has Sprung!

We spent LOTS of time outside over the past 2 weeks.

Here is Q munching on a carrot while enjoying the outdoors.

We had lots of nice long walks in Bay City. Here is Alex and Q looking out towards the Bay Bridge.
