## Happy Easter / Birthdays
Well we all continue to be in quarantine... Alex, Q and I have decided to separate ourselves from everyone aside from our little bubble which includes Alex's parents and my mom.  

We spent Easter with my mom and Kimmy in Easton.

It was also Brock's 4th birthday, and Oona's first birthday! Here is Oona and Q.

## Warm then Cold
The weather has been very back and forth! We had a nice few warm days, and we got to hang out outside.

Then all of a sudden it got cold again! Here is Q in his little warm fleece bear suit.

## Milestone Update
Q continues to grow! He will be 8 months next week! A big milestone is he is now starting to hold the bottle and feed himself. He is also not as interested in nursing anymore. That makes me sad, but I'm happy he is becoming more independent!

Alright, that's it for now! Boy this post made me tired. Time for a nap!
