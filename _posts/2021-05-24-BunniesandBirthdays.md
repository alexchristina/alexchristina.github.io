# May 12th - June 9th

## Bunnies!

There are several domestic bunnies that live just north of our house. We have gotten in the habit of going and feeding them on our daily walks. I haven't gotten a good picture of them yet, but here is Alex and Q feeding one of them who is hiding under a car. Their names are Pimento, Picote, and Aurello.

Q is having opinions on things! One of which is what type of chair he eats in for mealtime. Right now he wants to sit at his own table in his own chair. Here he is munching on some avocado toast and scrambled eggs.

It's springtime and boy has the weather been wonderful. Here is Q and I hanging out outside enjoying the nice weather.

We also spend lots of time at Idlewild park.

It's composting time! E even came over to help pick out worms from our worm composter to make room for the new kitchen scraps.

## Happy Birthday Alex!

Yay! Alex turns 34yo! Alex, Q and I all went out to a restaurant in Easton called Scossa. Q did EXCELLENT. We ate out on the patio.

Here is Q eating his favorite thing at the Scossa, bread and fancy spicy crackers.
