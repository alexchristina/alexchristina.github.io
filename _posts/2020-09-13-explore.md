## Exploration

Quentin is a toddler wandering around his environment and is ALWAYS exploring.

Sometimes it's exploring the kitchen sink.

Learning how to cook from Dad.

There is lots to explore outside! Such as a seesaw!

A big purple shovel on the beach.

And caterpillars!

Exploration sometimes has it's setbacks. Q was exploring the top of a picnic table, and in the blink of an eye stepped off and had a spill. Mommy wasn't watching close enough...

Thankfully he was OK, and brushed it off like a champ. That and Mommy learned that she needs to keep a closer eye on her little Q.

Will leave you with Q playing with yet another mop.
