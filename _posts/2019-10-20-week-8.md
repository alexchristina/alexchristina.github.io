## Halloween Campout 2019

What a good week and even more fun weekend! This week was week number 2 of me being back at work. I'm starting to feel more in the groove of things, am seeing predominately new patients still and will be for a while.

On my work days, Alex, Ava, and Q spend time together working! Here is a glimpse of their set up.

Other times, the work may take place on the kitchen table. Q will weigh in every once and a while with a coo of encouragement.

But let's get to the WEEKEND! We had the 20th annual Family Halloween Campout in Gettysburg PA! This is the 10th year I have been a part of this fabulous tradition. I think this is my favorite family gathering that Alex's side of the family does.

This was the first year the family got to meet both Ava and Quentin!

Quentin is the youngest family member to have attended the campout to date. He is just shy of 8 weeks.

One of my favorite parts of the weekend was playing games such as this one, Codenames!

To our surprise, some family members brought gifts for Q. Looks like he might be going to the moon soon in his new space outfit!

On Saturday evening it was finally costume time. Here we are dressed as Wall-e, Eve, and the plant from the movie Wall-e.

Will sign off this post with a group shot decked out in costume. So. Much. Fun. Can't wait to attend another 20 more.
