# April 13th - May 11th

## Time Flies!

So here we are, it's a month between posts again... but it does! Time absolutely flies! Lots of reasons it has flown by. One big one is that we have officially moved into our new house at 400 S Hanson Street in Easton MD. We. Love. This. House. It has it's quirks, and we will want to change some things, but it is home. All the pets and Q have adjusted to their new space.

So honestly that's the biggest reason I haven't posted in a while. Moving! I also don't have a ton of pictures over this past month, will aim to be better going forward.

## Prior To Moving

We tried to squeeze out the last bit of enjoyment out of living at the Stevensville house. We took advantage of being close to Annapolis by having dinner and drinks at Forward Brewing.

After dinner we walked around the harbor and pointed at birds.

Living on the water is awesome, and we will absolutely miss it. Here we are sitting in our back yard near the water blowing bubbles.

Another way we enjoyed being outside at our old house is by riding round on our balance bike!

## Post Move

After we moved in and settled in our new home, we made sure to enjoy our new nearby park, Idlewild!

Here are Q and I hanging out at the park

Q has decided he wants to help out by walking the dog.

Back at home, our garden is in full bloom! So many roses of all different colors. Here are a few of my favorite to end this post.
