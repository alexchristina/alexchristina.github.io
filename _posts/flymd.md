He went 8 days past his due date, but he's finally here. Quentin Bowman McCoy, born August 26th, 2019.

He had an uncomplicated (but very lengthy!) delivery and came out perfectly healthy, crying at the top of his little lungs.

Mom was tired but was also as healthy as could be.

I got to trim the umbilical cord, trying to focus through tears of joy.

We brought him home on Tuesday and let Ava lick his head and feet, thereby welcoming him into our pack.

Since then he's been nursing and sleeping like a little champ. Everyone warned us how difficult the first week would be but so far he's taking it quite easy on us. Hopefully that continues!
