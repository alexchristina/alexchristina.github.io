## Oh My!
Lots of fun new experiences these past 2 weeks.

Quentin is just shy of 6 months, and is continuing to improve in his fine motor skills. This has led us to giving him more varied foods! We are also trying to expose him to allergens to hopefully avoid allergies in the future.

So here is his first experience with peanut butter! (I think he likes it)

Here is Q trying some oatmeal with banana.

We went out to [Kentmorr](https://kentmorr.com/) for dinner, and Q tried some scallop and crab. Funnily enough, the lemons were his favorite!

Along with improvement in fine motor skills, comes improvements in general motor skills, like BOUNCING!

On Saturday, our friends Louie, Amanda, and Patrick stopped by for a quick visit.

On Sunday, the weather was beautiful and Q and I took a nice walk. We even got to meet some new friends!

That's it for the last 2 weeks! I will leave you with a picture of Quentin looking like he is up to no good.
