## It's so nice outside!
With warmer weather comes more time outside. This is particularly good since with social distancing in full swing, we cannot go out and do other activities.

We saw Grandma Carol during the week. Here she is with Q watching Ethan and Kimmy play badminton.

I impulse bought a fun new carrier for Q. Here is Alex trying it out.

And me trying it out! Q seems to like it!

With it being so sunny, I modified one of my other hats to fit Q.

## COVID
Maryland has continued to increase restrictions on people going out in public. Right now the only time we do leave the house is to go grocery shopping. Now it's just one of us that goes, and we get big orders so we don't have to go too frequently. They also have changed the recommendations regarding masks.

Here I am in my first home made DIY mask prior to heading to the grocery store.

All the gyms and yoga studios are closed. So Alex and I are working out at home. Here is Alex doing some weighted arm lifts with Q's assistance.

I'm doing yoga at home when Q let's me get away with it. Here we are in the kitchen. Multitasking cooking, watching the baby, and exercising!

## H2O
Quentin is drinking water! It's weird that he hasn't had any water (aside from what is in food/breastmilk) this whole time.

Here he is learning how to drink from a sippy cup!

He is definitely still in the put everything in one's mouth phase.
