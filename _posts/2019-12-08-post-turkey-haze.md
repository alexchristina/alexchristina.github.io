## Phew...

Got through our 3 thanksgivings. This week was a bit more relaxed, but also included quite a few Quentin firsts.

Alex and I are doing what is called Baby Led Weaning in terms of introducing food into his diet. This includes letting Q start exploring food and his motor skills by putting easy to pick up foods in front of him. Here he is starting down his first piece of broccoli.

Here he is with a few more foods on a subsequent dinner, this time at Grandma Carol's house.

Q does love his Mayor Pete binkie. Looks like he is having a staring contest with him.

As another first, Q attended his first concert! We saw the [Westminster Bell Ringers](http://westminsterringers.org "Bell Ringer's Home Page") perform at Christ Church Parish which is right down the road from us.

Q did VERY well, and looked like he enjoyed his first concert.

Thanks for stopping by! :)
