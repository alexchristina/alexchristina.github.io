## Happy Easter!

I keep thinking that this is Q's first Easter, but it's his second. He wasn't doing much though last year around this time since he was only 7 months old.

This year he got to hunt for easter eggs!

And inside the eggs - a little piece of chocolate!

Once the egg hunt was over, we hung out outside with our bunny ears and bubble maker.

Me-Ma and Pop-Pop got to hang out and watch the festivities.

## Camping Trip!

We went to Cape Henlopen State Park for our first camping trip with Quentin. We stayed in site G13 on a tent only loop. Dad, Angie, and Sam stayed on G14.

We also got to try out our new minivan with all our camping stuff. Boy were we happy to have the extra room!

Cape Henlopen has a lot of fun hiking trails and bike riding trails. One of them took us to the top of a small hill that overlooked the ocean.

We also spent lots of time hanging out at camp. Q LOVES being outside, so being outside at a campsite was so much fun.

He also got to spend nice quality time with Grandpa B, Grandma Angie, and Uncle Sam!

Please don't call CPS on us. Q likes being thrown up in the air. Lots of giggles!

So much to explore! We can't wait to come back.

Phew! What an adventure. Needed some extra sleep after that trip.
