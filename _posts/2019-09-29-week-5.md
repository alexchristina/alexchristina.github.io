Quentin is officially 1 month old!

Christina and Alex cannot believe how quickly this first month has gone! We have all gotten into somewhat of a routine, and have been enjoying spending all this time together. OK, now onto the pictures!

Here Q is striking a pose down at the water's edge in Bay City.

At the EXACT time of taking this picture, Q let out a very audible fart. And since Alex and Christina are still perfecting their cloth diaper folds... sometimes containment is a problem...

We walk down to the park in Bay City every morning. We all love being so close to the water!

Christina is not generally one for selfies, but here is a snuggly selfie with a very asleep Q.

Quentin had a doctor appointment this week, he is now 8lb 6oz! That is a whole 1.5lb more than at his appointment 2 weeks ago! Alex found one of his favorite Dr. Seuss books and shared it with Q while we waited for the doctor.

We are officially 1 month into doing cloth diapers. Since there is a lot of set up and stuff one needs at ones fingertips, Christina created this diaper work station! It came out pretty well I think!

We generally take an evening walk on most days, here is Q who we think is really TRYING to smile! Generally this doesn't happen until around 2 months... but we are still hoping to see him smile soon!

Just one more random picture of Q and Christina hanging out together on her green bumpy pillow!
