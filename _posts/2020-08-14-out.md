## Going Out 2 Eat

With the weather being nice down by the water, we have been spending lots of time outside. We have also frequented some of our favorite dining spots where you can sit outside and by the water.

Here we all are out at Kentmoor.

We went down to the little beach after dinner, and Q got to sit in the sand and watch the sun set.

We celebrated my 1 year with Waypoint by going out to Bridges.

While there we got to watch a nice big storm roll in.

## Outside Time!

Now that the playgrounds are open, we are going with Q to swing on the swing more frequently.

Q loves to swing!
