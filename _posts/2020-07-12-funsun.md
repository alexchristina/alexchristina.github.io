## Pools and Parks

Mum, Kim, Q and I got to spend an afternoon at the pool this past week! This was Quentin's second time in a big pool. He LOVES it! Here he is hanging out with Kimmy and a pool noodle!

Quentin, Alex and I took a nice bike ride down to the park in our community.

Quentin got to swing for a bit.

And then we all sat on a bench and watched the boats go by.

## Too hot!

We also spent quite a bit of time inside due to the hot/humid weather.

Quentin and Ava are getting along well, here they are playing with their rubber ducky.

Alex also does NOT do well in the heat, so he is certainly happy to be spending time inside with Q.

Plus being out in the heat makes you sleepy!

Well that's it for these past 2 weeks! Here is a final picture of Q enjoying swinging at the park.
