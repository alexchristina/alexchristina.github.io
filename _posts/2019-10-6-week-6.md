What a fun week! We started off on Sunday going to Ren Fest! Q did awesome during our 4 hour excursion.

And last but not least, Q is starting to SMILE! And not just when he is pooping! This is a milestone which generally occurs around 2 months. Here he is smiling at around 5 an 1/2 weeks! Ahead of the curve!
