## Feels Like Winter

So not too much happened (or I didn't take a lot of pictures) in week 11, so I decided to combine weeks 11 and 12 together. Alex, Ava, Quentin and I did spend the night at my moms, and got to walk around the Waterfowl Festival. The following weekend Q got to meet Juanita and Tom Foxwell! Also he got to hang out with grandpa Phil and grandma Angie!

### Now... onto the pictures!

Quentin as always loves spending time with Grandma Carol.

Both Alex and Ava were tuckered out after our walk around Easton.

Q is getting stronger every day, and although he needs a bit of help sitting up, he isn't flopping over so easily anymore!

Bath time is a lot of fun. Here is a tasteful bath time picture :)

On our walks, we have enjoyed the changing leaves. This is a tree I've been calling the "burnt marshmallow tree" for some time. Initially it was much more green in the middle and orange on the outside. It's much more burnt now!

On Saturday evening, MeMa came to visit and we all went out to [El Jefe's](http://eljefemexkitchen.com "El Jefe's website") a Texmex food place on the island.

Lastly I'll leave you with one of Q's infectious smiles.
