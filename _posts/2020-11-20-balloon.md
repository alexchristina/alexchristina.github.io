# November 2nd - November 22nd

## Balloons, Milkshakes, and Trikes

Brr! It's finally starting to feel a bit like fall! It's been so warm up until pretty recently. November has been full of days where a tank top is perfectly comfortable, as well as days where I need my big puffy parka.

At a neighbor's bday party, Q got to take home is very own balloon. He LOVED this thing. The first day we had it, he fell asleep for his nap with it still in his hand.

Here is Q checking out the neighbor's ducks.

We spent the day in Easton with Ba-Ba and E. Q got to try his first ever milkshake.

Then we went over to Idewild park for some swinging.

On one of the most recent warm days, Q got to try out his little trike. Someone in Bay City was giving this away for free, so we scooped it up. Q doesn't quite reach the peddles, but he will soon!

Alright, that's it for this post. Next one will be for THANKSGIVING! Woohoo!
