# June 18th - July 1st

## A Dishwasher!

So having a baby has increased the amount of dishes we use, AND who wants to be washing dishes when you can be playing with Q! So... mum has graciously agreed to get a dishwasher and help us install it. Boy this has been a BIG project. I don't have a before picture sadly, but here are the 2 pictures I got after 2 weekends of work.

After carefully taking apart the cabinets so we can reuse most of the lumber, we were able to slide the dishwasher into place, and then built a new bottom for the cabinets.

During the second weekend, we continued to work on building the cabinets.

The hope is this coming weekend, we will be able to complete most of the cabinet, and work on the plumbing and electrical components for the dishwasher.

## Father's Day and Family Time

Even though we spent a LOT of time working on the dishwasher, we made sure to spend time with friends and family.

Here is Q hanging out at ba-ba's house with E.

We stopped by and saw cousin Oona when we were all out for a bike ride.

After a long day of working on the dishwasher, we all sat out back for dinner.
