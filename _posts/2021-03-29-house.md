## We Bought A House!

We can't believe it! We have been looking in the Easton MD area for over a year for a very specific house in a very specific location. This house (400 S Hanson) went on the market on a Friday, we saw it that day, put in an offer on Monday, and it was accepted later that week. We are currently under contract, but it looks like we will be owners of this blue home, less than 1 block away from Ba-Bas!

## Irene

With us getting ready to move, we are making sure to get our current home (Irene Way) all ready to be rented again. This past weekend I cleaned out the gutters and did some landscaping to the front. I even trimmed all those big boxwoods!

Looks pretty good if I don't say so myself!

## By The Fire

With the weather warming up a bit, we have gotten to spend more time outside. It does still get pretty chilly though in the evenings. Thankfully Q help us put together a little fire by the water.

Q also got to try his first fire roasted marshmallow!

Didn't take too many pictures this past week. But what is extra exciting is we are going to be going camping next week with Grandpa Phil, Grandma Angie, and Sam! Will make sure to take lots of pics for that trip :)
