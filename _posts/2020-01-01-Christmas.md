## Merry Christmas

Hello! Quentin had his first Christmas this year, and he also is officially 4 months old! It's been a whirlwind of events over the past week.

On Christmas Eve, we spent the night at my dad's house in Mardela Springs. Here Q is on Christmas morning opening his first Christmas present.

Q's favorite part was definitely the wrapping paper.
