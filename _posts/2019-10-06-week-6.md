Milestone Update: Q is smiling!

What a fun week! We started off on Sunday going to Ren Fest. Q did awesome during our 4 hour excursion.

Q had a lot of fun people watching.

Pop pop stopped by and Q gave him a good looking over.

The cats are starting to warm up to Q, here is Declan sharing Quentin's pillow after a feeding.

It's starting to feel like fall, and Alex even found a woollybear caterpillar in our yard! A sure sign of fall!

The wind has also been picking up! Here is Christina and Quentin on a particularly windy day.

Overall Quentin is generally in a great mood. Here he is hanging out with Mom while watching Dad cook dinner.

Alex and Christina love playing boardgames. Even with a new baby in the house, they are making sure to spend some quality time doing things together.

And last but not least, Q is starting to SMILE! And not just when he is pooping! This is a milestone which generally occurs around 2 months. Here he is smiling at around 5 and 1/2 weeks! Ahead of the curve!

And that's it for this past week! Thanks for stopping by!
