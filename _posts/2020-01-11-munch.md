## Quentin's First Foods

At just over 4 months, we have been putting Q in his chair and placing different foods in front of him. He has become MUCH more interested in these foods over the past week. There has even been sightings of both carrot and broccoli pieces in his diaper! So... he is eating food! And feeding it to himself as well! I seriously thought about taking a picture of the evidence... but figured I'd spare you all. I did of course show it proudly to daddy :)

Everything goes into the mouth. Even grandma's thumb.

Who needs toys when you have kitchen implements!

Declan wanted some lap snuggles too... Q does not look happy about this.

This is a 9 month snow suit, but it was REALLY cold one day on our walk. He might look goofy, but he was certainly warm!

Thanks for checking in! See you next week!
