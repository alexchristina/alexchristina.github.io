# November 30th - December 12th

So with Thanksgiving over we have moved into listening to nonstop Christmas music and enjoying the ambiance of our Christmas tree!

Quentin LOVES playing in the sink. Here he is on his learning tower "helping" me do some dishes :)

Q tried raspberries for the first time! He likes putting them on his fingers and eating them off.

Quentin gets lots of yummy breakfast foods. He enjoys grits, pancakes, avocado toast, and bp&j toast. Here he is with some jam on his nose!

Quentin loves reading. He is constantly bringing us books to read to him. Sometimes they are kids books, but sometimes they are dishwasher manuals!

## Hanging Out In The Car

We continue to have spans of several days where it is nice and warm out (50-60s). During one of these warm spurts, Q, Declan, and I spent some time playing in the car.

Q might only be a bit over 15 months... but he is ready to drive!

We have such wonderful cats. Here is Declan giving Q some love while we hang out in the car.
