# May 18th - May 31st

Another eventful 2 weeks!

## Milestone Update

Quentin has been on the verge of crawling for a few weeks now. He has been able to crawl backwards, however this would generally get him farther away from whatever he was wanting to crawl towards which was frustrating to him!

However on Memorial day, May 25th, he definitely crawled forward!

## Memorial Day Weekend

We have been quarantining for some time now, and had only been seeing Alex's parents and my mom. We expanded our circle a bit this holiday weekend to include my dad and Benji! Neither my dad or Benji had seen Q since Janurary!  

Here we are at my mom's having some BBQ outside.

Here we all are at my dad's having lunch. Everyone is staring at Q!

## Q is 9 Months!

Horray! 9 months! Here is the little bug-a-boo crawling around at 9 months.

With Q being 9 months, he is now big enough to ride on a bike with Daddy! Here they are trying it out.

## Terrapin Park & Giggles

On saturday May 30th, we decided to go walk around Terrapin park for our morning dog walk.

We walked down to the beach and spent part of the morning there.

Q got to put his feet in the sand.

Q LOVES the cats, and certainly found them hilarious as they chased around a laser beam.

## Mother's Day Gift  

Yes yes, I know mother's day was on my last post. However I wanted to make sure I included my wonderful mother's day gift from Alex. My first year as a mother in video form!

With the weather being so nice, Q and I spend a lot of time outside.

Will sign off with Q pretending to be like daddy and drinking from his coffee cup.
