## 11 Months

Nope, can't believe it. A whole 11 months. 1 year is around the corner!

I tried to get a picture of him standing, because that is what he is doing a lot of at this age!

Q is a good eater. Here he is after having some chia pudding.

He also enjoys Daddy's home made raspberry Popsicles.

Even though it's hot out, Q enjoys spending his time outside near the water where there is often a nice cool breeze.

One of Q's favorite things is following the cats around. They have to move to higher ground to get away!

## Visiting Mardella Springs

We got to go visit my dad, Angie, and Sam! We also got to meet the newest members of the family, 3 baby Swifts!

Here they are being fed by Grandpa!

Q loves spending time with Grandpa, and he even shares his beloved raccoon.

## Raccoon!

Yes, Raccoon. This is one of Q's favorite toys. He brings him everywhere.

He plays with him inside.

And often brings him on walks outside.

Alright, that's it! Here is a nice picture of a rainbow we saw on one of our walks to end with. See you all later!
