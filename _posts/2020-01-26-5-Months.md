## Growing so fast!

I cannot believe Q is 5 months already...

I did end up combining last week and this week into 1 post, mostly because I didn't take enough pictures to account for a whole post.

Q enjoys standing on his own, and will occasionally take a step. His balance is getting better every day!

Alex has been trying to capture what we like to call his "wonder face." This is a pretty good picture of it.

Q got a new toy! He enjoys standing so much, he got a bouncer that he can now stand in.

Here is Q's "official" 5 month photo with his sticker.

The previous picture was pretty difficult to get, because he is in the stage where he likes to put EVERYTHING in his mouth... including the sticker.
