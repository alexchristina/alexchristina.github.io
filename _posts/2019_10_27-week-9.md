## 2 Months Old!

I can't believe it! 2 months old already. Over the past few weeks, Q has started to babble, is giving us more smiles, and is appearing to be more purposeful with his movements. He also had his 2 month pediatrician appointment and got his first round of shots :( Aside from a period of about 60 min of him being more fussy, he seems to be back to his normal happy self!

### Statistics
Height: 22in
Weight: 11lb 2oz
Head Circumference: 16in

This weekend we went to the Dog Park in Stevensville. There were lots of dogs for Ava to play with.

We also all went over to my mom's house in Easton. Ethan was there and helped out with the baby. Here he is feeding Q!

So most of the pictures I post are of Q being content or smiling. Of course this is NOT how he is ALL the time. Here is a nice picture of him when he is just about to lose it.

Of course I wouldn't want to sign off with a sad picture! So here is Q and me hanging out in the kitchen just enjoying each other's company.
