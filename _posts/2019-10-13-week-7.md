## Christina goes back to work...

So I'm going to stop writing in the third person because I find it annoying and strange. SO, with that being said, Christina here! I went back to work this week! I'm only working Mondays and Tuesdays, so not too much time spent away... but yes, Monday was hard. Juggling getting back into the groove of seeing patients, pumping, and not spending too much mental energy pining for Quentin was challenging.

While I was at work, things continued as usual at home. Quentin, Ava, and Alex went for a walk together down to the beach and took a nice selfie.

When I got home both days, I appreciated my time with Quentin and made sure to give him lots of smooches.

On Wednesday, Alex went to Bethesda for work and spent the night. This was my first time taking care of Q all by myself. I ended up going down to my mom's for some added support. Here is Grandma Carol and Q making googly eyes at each other.

With hurricane Dorian working up the coast, although it didn't hit any land, it sure pushed a LOT of water our way. This was our high tide near the end of this week!

Another nice change this week has been the weather! It's absolutely starting to feel like fall. Here is Q with his Halloween hat and socks.

OK! That's it for this week! Thanks!
