# June 1st - June 17th

## The Great Big Outdoors!

The weather has been absolutely beautiful. Q has been enjoying his days outside playing with grass and dandelions.

We also have been having some of our meals outside too.

We have dinner either Saturday or Sunday evening with Me-Ma and Pop-Pop.

Sometimes Q likes to nap outside on his favorite pillow.

With some of the restrictions being lifted, we all went out to Kentmorr for dinner.

Short and sweet post this week. Will leave you with a pic of our entire family in bed. Alex, Christina, Quentin, Ava, Declan, and Gimli. I think we may need a bigger bed!
