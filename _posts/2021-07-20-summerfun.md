# June 10th - July 29th

Ok... longest lapse between posts. I have an excuse! My chromebook died, and that was my main computer that I did my posting on. And I kind of don't know what I'm doing, so it took me a while to set up my Macbook. But now we are up and running! Lots to share on this post!

## Things Q Likes

### 1) Music

Especially live music. Here is Q and Baba watching a live jazz concert put together by the Easton HS Jazz band.

### 2) Sidewalk Chalk

These pictures were from a block party on July 4th. Quentin enjoyed the sidewalk chalk, but also kept rubbing his eyes. The result was too funny!

### 3) Dessert

Yes, he asks for dessert at all hours of the day. Sometimes it's the first thing he will say to me in the morning.

### 4) Drums

He keeps these at ba-ba's for obvious reasons... :)

### 5) Bike Riding

Daddy and Q have taken to doing rides every Sunday morning while I do a yoga class.

### 6) Boats!

Yes, boats. That really should be the title to this post. Quentin. Loves. Boats. Any type of boat really. We have some books about them, we look at pictures of them, and we got to ride some of them too!

I had my yearly beach party with work, and there were some kayaks we could use. Quentin spent 99% of the party riding on the kayaks.

We also got to go out on Kim's dad's boat!

## Kent Island VFD Carnival

This was Quentin's first carnival! We went on a beautiful Friday evening with Kelly, Rebecca, Brock, Oona, MeMa, Kimmy, and Ethan. Quentin mostly liked watching the rides vs riding them.

He was a bit freaked out by the helicopter ride.

## Tuckaho Steam & Gas Show

This is a Bowman tradition! I've been going to the steam and gas show since I was a kiddo. Always such fun!

Here is Alex and Q making the long walk to the show.

## Photo Dump

Don't have any cute theme to tie these last photos together. This is a lesson to make sure I don't go so long between posts!
