## Happy Birthday Q

I can't believe it's already been a full year. Quentin has changed so much in the past 12 months! Also, this birthday Alex and I got to celebrate our first year as parents. What a fun time it has been. We are so excited for the future with little Q.

So we celebrated Q's birthday a little early while we were at Rehoboth. Here he is doing 2 of his favorite things on the beach.

Playing in his little tidal pool.

And sleeping on daddy.

Q got to have lots of sweets for his birthday too! He got to try ice cream for the first time.

And funfetti cake!

We wanted to also say a big THANK YOU to Q's grandparents who help out SO MUCH with watching Q during the week. Having a good support system has made being a parent so enjoyable, and we cannot thank you enough.

I'll end this post with Q when he was helping me out lick the batter off the whisk after making his birthday cupcakes.
