## Happy Thanksgiving!

This was Quentin's first Thanksgiving, and we all got to have a total of 3 dinners with friends and family! We are so lucky to have such wonderful people in our lives.

On Wednesday, Quentin, Ava, Alex and I drove down to St. Michaels to spend Thanksgiving part 1 with the Myers family!

On Thursday, we all spent dinner together at my mom's house in Easton. Sadly I didn't think to take many pictures, but here is one of our beautiful HUGE turkey.

Lastly, on Friday, Alex, Quentin and I hosted a final thanksgiving dinner at our house in Stevensville Maryland.

## Quentin is 3 Months!

Can you believe it?! 3 months! He is just now starting to reach for things such as rattles and other hanging toys. It's so much fun to see how his fine motor movements improve each day.
