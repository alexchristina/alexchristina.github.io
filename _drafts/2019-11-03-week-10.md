## Happy Halloween

Let's see... what happened this week...

Well in the Q realm, he has discovered the joys of munching on his hands. Here we have Q and I eating our fingers together.

Along with his newly found love of putting his hands in his mouth, he is also learning to maneuver objects to his mouth too!

Even though Q seems to change so much each week, he still is cute as a button! Here he is on one of our morning walks.

He is getting more head control every day!

Although the attention we give our pets has diminished with the addition of Q to our family unit, Alex still makes time for some Gimli snuggles.
