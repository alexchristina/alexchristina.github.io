# 5th Wedding Anniversary

On October 4th 2014, Alex and Christina got to say "I do" in front of their family and friends. Five years have passed since Christina vowed to be Alex's "sous-chef" and Alex vowed to let Christina continue to eat all the M&M's out of the trail mix. So far, both have kept up their end of the bargain. They also continue to be madly in love with each other, so there is that too!

Per tradition, Alex and Christina have opted to celebrate their anniversaries by making the gift for one another each year. They have gone the "Traditional" route, and for the 5th anniversary year, the medium is WOOD.

Christina: One thing that we did quite a bit of when we first returned to Maryland, was eat crabs! Since I'm not much of a woodworker, I opted to take one of our crab mallets and personalize it by burning an engraving commemorating our anniversary!
