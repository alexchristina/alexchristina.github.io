** Setting up the computer
*** Install Git  
The first step to being able to edit the website on your computer is to install git:
**** Optional: Install Jekyll for local website editing
This is nice so you don't have to push your website to Github every time you want to see how your site looks

*** Configure your local directory

*** Clone your blog into the local directory

*** How to create a post

Posts are for blog-style updates with dates. They are stored in the ~_posts~ directory of our website folder with the format:

~`yyyy-mm-dd-post-title.md~

So let's first navigate to our directory with:

~cd ~/blogs/alexandchristina.github.io/_posts~

Now that we're in the right directory,  let's make a new post with our text editor and call it ~2019-08-26-a-wild-quentin-appears.md~.

/Optional:/ It might be easier to copy an existing file as a kind of template. For example, we can use the ~standard~ template by executing:

~cp 2019-01-01-standard.md 2019-08-26-a-wild-quentin-appears.md~

Which copies a good starting template to a new file with our desired file name.

Now let's edit our file. At the top is the *Front Matter* which tells Jekyll some important info. It's pretty intuitive to edit this stuff. Make sure the title is correct and, since we're writing a blog post about Quentin, add a Quentin tag.

Now we're ready to edit the main body of the website!

*** Writing our blog!

Everything under the ~---~ in the front matter is fair game for editing our blog. So, just type some text!

He went 8 days past his due date, but he's finally here. Quentin Bowman McCoy, born August 26th, 2019.

[[Cute Quentin][/assets/images/00100lPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20190828103130836_COVER.jpg]

He had an uncomplicated (but very lengthy!) delivery and came out perfectly healthy, crying at the top of his little lungs.

Mom was tired but was also as healthy as could be.

I got to trim the umbilical cord, trying to focus through tears of joy.

We brought him home on Tuesday and let Ava lick his head and feet, thereby welcoming him into our pack.

Since then he's been nursing and sleeping like a little champ. Everyone warned us how difficult the first week would be but so far he's taking it quite easy on us. Hopefully that continues! Christina and I wish you could have met him in person. Thank you for being such great landlord-friends and neighbors. I'm a new dad so I'll probably send you a bunch more photos until it gets annoying. Hope everything is great in the midwest!

Love, 

Alex, Christina, Quentin, Ava, Declan, & Gimli

P.S. The cats have been mostly ambivalent, though I imagine they're not happy to have to share their new favorite sleeping locales: Q's bassinet and crib.

So everything below the ~---~ is fair game for text and images. Text is easy, we just type what we want. So, let's enter the following text into our blog post:

He went 8 days past his due date, but he's finally here. Quentin Bowman McCoy, born August 26th, 2019.

This text will be automatically rendered on our webpage, which is cool.

**** Adding images

I wish I could say that images are just "drag and drop" but unfortunately they're a bit fussy. Once you get used to it, it's not so bad. The short answer is that all images for our website live in the ~/assets/images~ folder in the root of our blog, so:

~/home/alzxjm/blogs/alexchristina.github.io/assets/images~

You don't have to type that every time: you can just start with the ~/assets~ part and go forward from there. So, to add a photo, we use the Markdown syntax:

~![Image Title](/path/to/image.jpg)~. If we want to insert an image into our page, we write:

~![Cute Quentin!](/assets/images/cute-quentin-early.jpg)~
