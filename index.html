<h1> Happy Birthday, Christina!</h1>

  <p>
    This is our website! This is where we'll share pictures and stories and stuff. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The real gift is <a href="https://www.mccoybowman.com/guide">this guide</a> on how to use the site. I know a static website hosted on Github Pages seems like a bit of a chore, but I hope that this guide helps you get started, and that once you write a few pages and posts it'll seem easy!
