<h1> Happy Birthday, Christina!</h1>

  <p>
    This is our website! This is where we'll share pictures and stories and stuff. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The real gift is <a href="https://www.mccoybowman.com/guide">this guide</a> on how to use the site. I know a static website hosted on Github Pages seems like a bit of a chore, but I hope that this guide helps you get started, and that once you write a few pages and posts it'll seem easy!

    By the way, we need more pictures of the family! All of us! It was hard finding good ones for the site, especially one to go in the splash image above!
